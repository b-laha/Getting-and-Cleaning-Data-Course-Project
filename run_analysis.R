#One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - 
#see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to 
#develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the 
#course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S 
#smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
#  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Here are the data for the project:
#  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of   
#   each variable for each activity and each subject.


library(plyr)

# Step 1
# Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
